Hands-On Practice Files

Welcome to my collection of hands-on practice files! This repository contains code snippets and practice exercises I completed while learning from the video tutorial available [here](https://youtu.be/NpmFbWO6HPU?si=-BcXyxI0sd4O_jOx).

I created this repo to keep a personal record of my learning process and to provide a reference for anyone else working through similar concepts. The files cover various exercises and concepts from the tutorial, and they are organized for easy reference.
